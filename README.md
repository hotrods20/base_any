# base_any
A very basic script to create and test any type of BASE.

Create an instance of the base_any class and convert your numbers to whatever base that you wish to use.

Quick Notes:
Currently doesn't support letters. That is in a future version.
Written in PHP because when you have a hammer, all problems are nails.
